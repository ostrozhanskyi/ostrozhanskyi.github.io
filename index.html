    <h1>ü§î</h1>

    <p>What is this Barbie-pink ending? His last words redeemed it a bit, but still... And of course, it's not without some final fight scene. Why? It was so good until the last 15 minutes.</p>

    <p>I loved the bookstore setting returning for the final season. It felt fitting.</p>

    <p>How much damage can one psychopath cause with a bit of luck and the direct‚Äîor indirect‚Äîhelp of others?</p>

    <p>There were a lot of good moments. Overall, it was good. Except for the man-hating agenda.</p>

    <p>They really showed how heartless Reagan was‚Äîno compassion for her own twin, even when both were in danger. I liked the actress, though. She played both twins really well. The bathroom scene, when Kate showed up at her home, was especially strong.</p>

    <p>Joe continued to be, apart from a murderous maniac, a cheater and self-serving prick. Yet another girl fell for his "charms," only to get a wake-up call eventually.</p>

    <p>The Bronte storyline is so messed up. It‚Äôs both good and bad. Not bad in terms of story structure, but I just couldn‚Äôt buy her falling for him like that and forgetting all about Beck. It made sense from the fake "Bronte" persona‚Äôs perspective, but not from her real-life character. I expected her to be portrayed as more intelligent from the start.</p>

    <p>Kate had her wake-up call too. They showed how we justify what we think is ‚Äúright‚Äù in the moment and ignore things that are equally or even more important‚Äîjust to feel good now, without considering the future.</p>

    <p>Joe's manipulation of Maddy and his attempt with Harrison felt believable. Harrison realizing for the first time that he was actually being cheated on‚Äîthat part was well done.</p>

    <p>Why do no women in this story have a good man? It's crazy. Not even one example of a decent guy who lasted long enough to matter on screen‚Äîpun intended. From Joe‚Äôs father to Moonie, and all the men in between, even the one Joe put in the cage after attacking Bronte‚Äîthey‚Äôre all twisted in their own way.</p>

    <p>But it‚Äôs not like they depict <em>everyone</em> like that. Some women have flaws too, and it‚Äôs about 50/50 overall. There are plenty of well-rounded female characters. So why not just one good man to provide contrast?</p>

    <p>Okay‚ÄîI was wrong. There <em>is</em> one: Kate‚Äôs half-brother, who‚Äôs gay. I remembered him when Kate signed over the company. But I meant a good man <em>for a woman</em>.</p>

    <p>While I was watching, I kept hoping Bronte was really just pretending‚Äîto become someone else like Maddie, to break him. A bit insane, sure, but playing a long game just to hurt him. Maybe that‚Äôs silly, but from my perspective, it would‚Äôve been satisfying.</p>

    <p>The part with his son was perfect. It felt like a fitting conclusion. But honestly, I still don‚Äôt think Joe was hurt enough. Her shooting him in the forest? That was awful. I wonder which feminist writer thought that was a good idea to include.</p>

    <p>The scene with Marienne and Bronte in the bookshop was powerful. But the transition‚Äîfrom love and understanding back to her old self‚Äîfelt too rushed.</p>

    <p>Joe‚Äôs character really shows how words can carry passion and feel meaningful in the moment, but he‚Äôs ultimately just a psycho. He can flip at any second, and you never know when it‚Äôll happen‚Äîbut it always does. All those beautiful, romantic moments can turn to carnage in the blink of an eye.</p>

    <p>So, rotting in prison is a fitting end... but still not enough for me.</p>
